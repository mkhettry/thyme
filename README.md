Thyme & money: Command line personal finance tool

If you are up for some manual wrangling, you can use this to load qfx files from your financial institutions and do
some basic analyses of your (in my case, profligate) spending habits.

To use it, you will need a python dev environment and a postgres database. Its a Work In Progress. You have been warned.
