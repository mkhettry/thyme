Thyme & money: Command line personal finance tool

Duh?
====

Thyme is a simple command line tool for tracking and understanding expenses. A typical workflow for using thyme is
as follows:

* Download qfx files from your bank or credit card.
* Use the load command to load transactions from the qfx file.
* Categorize any transactions that thyme couldn't categorize
* Use list and bycat to view and understand your expenses.

In this day and age of mobile phones and personal finance software, why would you use thyme? Here are a few reasons

* You don't give out sensitive credentials to your financial institutions to a third-party.
* Your financial data lives on your computer.
* If you are comfortable with the command line, you are likely going to be more productive exploring your spending.

Here is a screenshot of a typical interaction in thyme.

How do I get started?
=====================
You will need

* A python dev environment. This means virtualenv and all the good stuff.
* sqllite

Once you have these setup, startup thyme `python thyme.py` and you are good to go.
